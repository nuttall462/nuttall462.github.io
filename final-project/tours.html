      <h2>Top 5 Things to do in Cozumel:</h2>
      <section id="sightseeing">
        <h3>#1 Swimming with the Dolphins</h3>
        <div class="main-box">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="dolphins"></div>
            <div class="back">
              <p>If you're looking for a fun water-based activity, Cozumel has a number of popular 
              dolphin experiences worth considering. One of the best on the island can be enjoyed 
              at Dolphinaris Cozumel, which offers an exciting program of dolphin swims. Packages 
              should be booked in advance (remember, these places are popular with cruise ship 
              vacationers, too) and are suitable for families traveling with kids, as the waters 
              are shallow. The experience includes up-close encounters with these remarkable 
              creatures, as well as use of on-site facilities including restaurants, change rooms, 
              and souvenir shops.Another top-rated attraction on the island is Dolphin Discovery 
              Cozumel. Situated in Chankanaab National Park, the location itself is stunningly 
              beautiful and, with its reefs, makes for an excellent place to linger and try your 
              hand at some snorkeling or diving. A variety of dolphin experiences are offered, 
              including some with swimming fun as they tow you through the water. Other creatures 
              you'll meet here include manatees and sea lions.</p>

        <h3>#2 Visit the Calarain Lighthouse</h3>
        <div class="main-box">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="lighthouse"></div>
            <div class="back">
              <p>The best known of Cozumel's lighthouses is Celarain (Faro de Celarain), 30 kilometers
              south of the capital of San Miguel. Built in 1901 and recently fully restored with the 
              addition of an interesting maritime museum in the old lighthouse keeper's home, the 
              lighthouse is perched at the southernmost tip of the island in the nature reserve known 
              as Parque Punta Sur and is worth the visit and the climb of its 134 steps for its wonderful 
              iews over the Caribbean Sea. It's a fun little excursion and perfect for those looking for
              something that is typically not swamped with the cruise crowds.</p>

        <h3>#3 Discover Mexico Park</h3>
        <div class="main-box">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="park"></div>
            <div class="back">
              <p>Particularly popular among cruise ship passengers during their Cozumel stopover, 
              Discover Mexico Park Cozumel is one of the newest attractions on the island. In addition 
              to providing an interesting overview of Mexico's many diverse cultures, highlights include 
              miniature reconstructions of many of the country's most important archaeological sites and 
              historic attractions.
              Also of interest are the exhibits and multi-media shows showcasing traditional music, art, 
              and food—including a chance to sample locally made chocolate—along with displays of 
              traditional dances. A fascinating sight is the daring Danza de los Voladores (Dance of the 
              Flyers) involving participants throwing themselves off a 30-meter-tall pole as they spin and
              twirl to the ground via ropes attached to their feet.</p>

        <h3>#4 Museum of the Island of Cozumel</h3>
        <div class="main-box">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="museum"></div>
            <div class="back">
              <p>In the heart of San Miguel de Cozumel, the excellent Museum of the Island of Cozumel 
              (Museo de la Isla de Cozumel) makes for a fun break from the beach. The museum offers a 
              great deal of information related to the history of the island and its people, from its 
              formation millions of years ago to its current status as one of the Caribbean's most 
              visited tourist destinations.
              In addition to its multi-media displays and permanent collections of ancient artifacts, 
              the museum also hosts numerous temporary exhibits, including artwork from both international
              and local artists. Of particular interest is the exhibit dealing with marine life, as well
              as a mock-up of the traditional Mayan homes that were once common across the island 
              (there's also an on-site restaurant).</p>

        <h3>#5 Diving in the Palancar Reef</h3>
        <div class="main-box">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="reef"></div>
            <div class="back">
              <p>One of the best spots to dive is the Palancar Reef, rising from depths of up to 80 meters
                to shallows just beneath the surface of the sea at the southwest end of the island. A 
                popular dive includes a large bronze figure of Christ placed some 17 meters underwater. 
                Other good diving locales are on the San Francisco, Paraíso, Columbia, and Maracaibo reefs,
                as well as the Santa Rosa Wall. And pretty much wherever you dive, you're certain to see such 
                exotic species as angelfish, nurse sharks, sunfish, and sea turtles.
               One of the best ways to explore the reefs is by joining a Cozumel Snorkeling Tour of Palancar,
                Columbia, and Cielo reefs. This fun, half-day, guided adventure includes travel aboard a 
                glass-bottom boat to the National Marine Park and snorkeling at El Cielo, famous for its 
                sandy bottom and countless sea stars, as well as Palancar Reef with colorful coral. Included 
                with your three-reef trip are complimentary beverages, plus a choice of morning or afternoon 
                departures.</p>

      <h2>The History of Cozumel</h2>
      <p>Cozumel Mexico was first settled by the Maya some 2000 years ago during the classic period
         between 300 and 900 AC. The predominant settlements were located around religious centers 
         San Gervasio and El Cedral. The Name Cozumel was given to it by the Spaniards; however its 
         origin is derived from the words Cuzam (meaning Swallow) and Lumil (meaning land of). This 
         is why the combination of the words “Cuzamil” is translated from the Mayan language as “Land 
         of the Swallows”. It is no wonder that the Mayans gave Cozumel this name because every year 
         around April and May during their migration period, Swallows can be seen in great numbers 
         flying overhead.</p>
      <p>	
        It became an important seaport for Mayan trade because it was well positioned in the 
        middle of routes to and from Honduras and Veracruz. In addition, Cozumel history began as 
        a pilgrimage site; the shrines of Ixchel, goddess of fertility, drew worshippers from all 
        over the Mayan empire. The site of this worshiping was what is now the San Gervasio ruins, 
        located on the transversal road going east on the island. Another archeological site which 
        defines Cozumel history, is El Cedral. El Cedral is located on the southeast interior of the 
        island.</p>
      <p>In the 17th century, pirates took advantage of Cozumel's isolation and used it as a base 
        for operations. The most notable of Cozumel's pirates was American pirate Jean Lafitte. The 
        island was not re-inhabited until 1848, when settlers from the mainland sought refuge there
         from the Caste War, a fierce war that broke out when the Mayas decided to avenge the wrongs 
         inflicted on them and their lands by the Spanish. In the end, the white settlers prevailed. 
         And so it still remains a part of Cozumel history.</p>
      <p>Cozumel remained a quiet little fishing community until 1961, when French explorer Jacques 
        Cousteau proclaimed the area's waters one of the most spectacular scuba diving sites in the
         world. The island became a divers' haven and eventually, a cruise ship port-of-call. Today, 
         Cozumel has evolved into a tourist destination popular even with people who don't scuba dive. 
         It is overshadowed by nearby Cancun in terms of grandiose development, but that fact suits 
         most of its visitors just fine.Cozumel remained a quiet little fishing community until
          discovered by the tourism industry in the '60s.</p>
      <p>Today Cozumel Island, Mexico is a destination vacation spot for millions of visitors annually.
         Come to our island and see why it has stood the test of time and is more then ever the gem of
        the "Mayan Riviera".It is no small wonder that today's Cozumel has evolved into a world class 
        tourist destination. The rich history of its native people and culture, combined with the 
        natural beauty which is evident in the pristine beaches, crystal clear azure seas, a vast 
        variety of shopping alternatives as well as night time activities make this island paradise
         truly amazing.</p>
